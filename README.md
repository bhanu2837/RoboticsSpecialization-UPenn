# Projects from the Coursera Robotics Specialization

This repo contains the solutions from all the major programming assignements in this Coursera Course.
1. Aerial Robotics concerns developping a 3d PD controller and a trajectory generator for a `quadcopter`.
2. Computational Motion planning deals with Path Planning using `Djikstras and A* Algoritmh`, using Djikstras to navigate a `3 degrees of freedom arm ` avoiding obstacles, and implementing `gradient descend` for finding optimal path(2d Space).
3.Perception contains the implementation of Dolly Zoom, image projection and a basic `AR`.
4. Estimation and Learning entails `Color Learning and Target detection`, `Kalman Filtering`, `Occupancy Grid Mapping` and `Particle Filter Based Localisation`.
5. The Capstone Project is the impementation of a `Mobile Inverted Pendulum`. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Matlab installed if you want to run the programs on your machine  with the appropriate libraries installed. The data used specifically for this course are not included but any similar data should work fine.
